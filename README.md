# dice_roller_with_images

This is a dice roller app which i have created taking inspiration from one of my mentors repo.<br>
Link:-https://github.com/S-ayanide/Flutter-DiceRoller<br>
The basic app contained two dices which were rolled and were showing respective images each time the button was clicked. <br>
I have added a sound to this such that whenever the button is clicked the sound will be played and dice will be rolled accordingly.<br>Also i have added some delay to the image loading due to which the images now take 1.5 seconds to load and display which was necessary to give user the feel of dice rolling and the numbered images being loaded accordingly.<br>
Things which are done in the app involves:
* MaterialApp class/design.
* Scaffold Class.
* AppBar.
* Use of functions and variables.
* Stateless and Stateful widget.
* Sound on button click
* Use of timer to sync the sound and images

Built using
